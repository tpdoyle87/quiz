This page was build using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. It has a basic form with employee information fields. When the form is
submitted it makes a ajax request. When it recieves a successful response it will display an alert to the user letting them 
know that the information has been saved.

This project does not use bootstrap or any css preprocessors, it pulls one jquery library. Input mask is used to format 
and validate the Phone number input. The jQuery library is pulled in using a cdn.

You can see the page hosted and working at tpdoyle87.github.io/quiz
